## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT

This project built an AI system that helps online retailers optimize their product recommendations to customers. Instead of randomly testing different strategies, the system intelligently learns from customer behavior to find the best approach. It successfully increased conversion rates by 27.3% (from 10.2% to 13.0%) and session values by 26.8% (€5.14 to €6.52), potentially worth €2.79 million annually through simulation-based modeling. The breakthrough came from balancing competing business goals and understanding trade-offs between immediate sales and long-term customer relationships. The system is 1,800 times faster than traditional testing methods while providing confidence levels for business decisions.

## MODEL

**Architecture**: Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization using 6 separate Gaussian Process models  
**Kernels**: RBF (Radial Basis Function) + White Noise for uncertainty quantification  
**Acquisition Function**: Expected Hypervolume Improvement with Monte Carlo sampling (200 samples)  
**Optimization Method**: L-BFGS-B with 150 random restarts for global optimization  

**Why This Model**:
- **Efficiency**: Learns from each experiment to predict optimal settings
- **Multi-objective**: Optimizes 6 competing business objectives simultaneously  
- **Uncertainty-aware**: Provides 95% confidence intervals for business decisions
- **Sample efficient**: Finds optimal solutions in 50 experiments vs 46,656 traditional combinations
- **Pareto optimization**: Discovers optimal trade-off strategies between competing objectives

**Technical Innovation**: Temporal constraint integration enabling 88.2% optimization coverage while handling real-world data limitations.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMISATION

**Strategic Parameters Optimized** (6-dimensional space):

1. **Popularity vs Discovery** (0.0-1.0): Balance trending vs niche products
2. **Engagement vs Conversion** (0.0-1.0): Optimize for browsing vs purchasing  
3. **Similarity vs Diversity** (0.0-1.0): Personalized vs exploratory recommendations
4. **Recent vs Historical** (0.0-1.0): Fresh vs established behavior patterns
5. **Immediate vs Future** (0.0-1.0): Session value vs lifetime value trade-offs
6. **Safe vs Experimental** (0.0-1.0): Conservative vs innovative strategies

**Optimization Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: 10 random initial experiments for baseline understanding
- **Phase 2**: 40 Bayesian-guided experiments using Gaussian Process learning

# OTTO Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Framework
Multi-objective Bayesian optimization framework for e-commerce recommendation systems. Imperial College London capstone project demonstrating €39M revenue opportunity through intelligent hyperparameter tuning with uncertainty quantification.

## Executive Summary
This project built an intelligent optimization framework that helps online retailers like OTTO make better product recommendations to customers. Instead of guessing which recommendation strategy works best, the system learns from customer behavior and automatically finds optimal settings. It balances competing business goals like getting more clicks versus making more sales. The system tested 50 different strategies and found combinations that could increase sales by 127%, potentially worth €39 million annually. The approach is 1,800 times faster than traditional testing methods and provides confidence levels for business decision-making.

## Key Results
- **Conversion Improvement**: 127.8% (10.2% → 23.2%)
- **Revenue Opportunity**: €39.1M annually
- **Optimization Efficiency**: 50 experiments vs 46,656 needed (99.9% reduction)
- **Decision Intelligence**: 95% confidence intervals for business decisions
- **Speed Advantage**: 1,800x faster than traditional A/B testing

## Technical Approach
- Multi-objective Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Processes
- Expected Hypervolume Improvement acquisition function
- 6 hyperparameter optimization across competing business objectives
- Uncertainty quantification for decision intelligence

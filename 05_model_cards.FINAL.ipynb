      "This project built an AI system that helps online retailers optimize their product recommendations to customers. Instead of randomly testing different strategies, the system intelligently learns from customer behavior to find the best approach. It successfully increased conversion rates by 27.3% (from 10.2% to 13.0%) and session values by 26.8% (‚Ç¨5.14 to ‚Ç¨6.52), potentially worth ‚Ç¨2.79 million annually through simulation-based modeling. The breakthrough came from balancing competing business goals and understanding trade-offs between immediate sales and long-term customer relationships. The system is 1,800 times faster than traditional testing methods while providing confidence levels for business decisions.\n",

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labelling

**Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done?**

**Data Cleaning Applied:**
- **Customer Anonymization**: Personal identifiers replaced with anonymous customer IDs
- **Session Segmentation**: Customer activities grouped into sessions with ≤2 hour gap thresholds
- **Event Validation**: Invalid or malformed interaction events removed
- **Product ID Standardization**: Product identifiers normalized to consistent format
- **Temporal Ordering**: Events chronologically sorted within customer sessions

**Feature Engineering Performed:**
- **Baseline Metrics Calculation**: 
  - Session conversion rate: 10.2% (measured from real customer behavior)
  - Average session value: €5.14 (calculated from actual transactions)
  - Customer engagement rate: 85% (derived from interaction patterns)
  - Future value calculation: €24.69 average 5-day future session value

**Business Logic Implementation:**
- **Conversion Definition**: Purchase completion within customer session
- **Session Value**: Total transaction value per customer session
- **Engagement Metrics**: Click-through rates and interaction depth measures
- **Temporal Constraints**: Strategic Dial #5 optimization limited to Days 1-23 (88.2% coverage)

**Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed data?**
- **Raw Data Retention**: Original interaction logs maintained by OTTO for business operations
- **Processed Dataset**: Kaggle competition version represents cleaned, anonymized subset
- **Academic Use**: Processed data sufficient for research methodology demonstration
- **Version Control**: Dataset versioning maintained for reproducibility
- **Documentation**: Data processing pipeline documented for transparency

## Uses

**What other tasks could the dataset be used for?**
- **Recommendation System Research**: Algorithm development and benchmarking
- **Customer Journey Analysis**: Understanding e-commerce behavior patterns
- **Temporal Pattern Mining**: Seasonal and cyclical behavior identification
- **Conversion Optimization**: A/B testing framework development
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Product affinity and cross-selling research
- **Churn Prediction**: Customer retention modeling
- **Personalization Research**: Individual customer preference learning
- **Business Intelligence**: E-commerce performance analytics methodology

**Impact on future uses - potential risks and mitigations:**
- **Geographic Bias Risk**: German shopping behavior may not generalize globally
  - *Mitigation*: Acknowledge limitations and validate findings across markets
- **Temporal Bias Risk**: Summer 2022 patterns may not reflect other periods
  - *Mitigation*: Collect additional seasonal data for broader validation
- **Product Category Limitations**: Missing product descriptions limit certain analyses
  - *Mitigation*: Combine with external product categorization datasets
- **Demographic Blindness**: No customer demographic data limits personalization research
  - *Mitigation*: Use behavioral segmentation rather than demographic targeting

**Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?**
- **Individual Customer Profiling**: Lacks sufficient personal data for individual targeting
- **Real-time Recommendation Systems**: Dataset is historical, not suitable for live systems
- **Financial Decision Making**: Simulation-based results require production validation
- **Cross-Cultural Research**: German market focus limits international applicability
- **Long-term Trend Analysis**: 28-day window insufficient for annual pattern analysis
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Should not be used to reverse-engineer OTTO's specific strategies

## Limitations

### Academic & Methodological Constraints
- **Simulation-Based Impact**: Business relationships modeled from e-commerce literature, not empirically derived
- **Temporal Limitations**: 28-day observation window restricts long-term impact measurement
- **Geographic Scope**: German customer behavior may not generalize globally
- **Seasonal Constraints**: Summer 2022 patterns may not reflect other periods
- **Strategic Dial #5 Coverage**: Only 88.2% of sessions due to temporal constraints

### Technical Limitations
- **Gaussian Process Assumptions**: May not hold for all business optimization scenarios
- **Computational Complexity**: Requires significant ML engineering expertise
- **Data Dependency**: Performance quality depends on training data quality
- **Calibration Requirements**: Framework needs tuning for each specific business context
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Acquisition function parameters require careful tuning

### Business Implementation Constraints
- **A/B Testing Required**: Production validation needed before deployment
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Requires buy-in from multiple business functions
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Needs robust data pipelines and monitoring systems
- **Change Management**: Complex optimization requires organizational readiness
- **Competitive Advantage**: Advanced optimization may create market imbalances

## Trade-offs

### Multi-Objective Optimization Trade-offs
**Strategic Dials with Positive Conversion Impact:**
- Recent vs Historical Behavior: +5.8% individual contribution
- Engagement vs Conversion Focus: +4.9% individual contribution  
- Popularity vs Discovery Balance: +2.1% individual contribution

**Strategic Dials with Trade-off Costs (Optimizing Other Objectives):**
- Immediate vs Future Focus: -4.5% conversion (optimizes lifetime value +29.6%)
- Safe vs Experimental Strategy: -0.6% conversion (drives innovation and differentiation)
- Similarity vs Diversity Balance: -0.2% conversion (enhances discovery and exploration)

**Net Result**: +7.5% total conversion benefit through intelligent trade-off management

### Performance vs Complexity Trade-offs
- **Accuracy vs Speed**: High-quality optimization requires 50+ experiments vs simple heuristics
- **Interpretability vs Performance**: Complex multi-objective results vs simple single-metric optimization
- **Certainty vs Innovation**: Conservative estimates (60% confidence) vs aggressive projections
- **Immediate vs Future Value**: Short-term conversion gains vs long-term customer relationships

### Business Context Trade-offs
- **Conversion vs Discovery**: Aggressive sales optimization reduces product exploration
- **Personalization vs Diversity**: Targeted recommendations limit customer choice discovery
- **Efficiency vs Fairness**: Business optimization may not serve all customer segments equally
- **Innovation vs Reliability**: Experimental features create uncertainty vs proven approaches

### Implementation Trade-offs
- **Resource Investment**: Significant ML engineering effort vs simple A/B testing
- **Organizational Change**: Complex decision framework vs intuition-based choices
- **Risk Management**: Sophisticated uncertainty quantification vs simple success metrics
- **Competitive Advantage**: Advanced optimization capability vs industry standard approaches

**Critical Insight**: The framework demonstrates that effective business optimization requires accepting and managing trade-offs rather than seeking universal improvements. Strategic Dial #5's -4.5% conversion cost for +29.6% future value exemplifies intelligent long-term thinking over short-term gains.

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias & Fairness Assessment
- **Dataset Bias**: German customers, summer shopping patterns may not represent global behavior
- **Algorithm Bias**: Hand-crafted business rules embed designer assumptions about optimal behavior
- **Optimization Bias**: System may favor easily measured metrics over truly important outcomes
- **Customer Segmentation**: Advanced optimization might advantage high-value customers disproportionately

### Responsible AI Framework
- **Transparency**: Provide clear explanation of recommendation logic to stakeholders
- **Human Oversight**: Require business stakeholder approval for significant strategy changes
- **Gradual Deployment**: Test on small traffic percentages before full implementation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Track customer satisfaction alongside business performance metrics
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to quickly revert changes if negative effects detected

### Privacy & Data Protection
- **Data Minimization**: Uses only interaction data (clicks, purchases), no personal information
- **Anonymization**: Customer identifiers removed in source dataset
- **GDPR Compliance**: Academic research framework with minimal data collection
- **Purpose Limitation**: Methodology demonstration rather than commercial exploitation

---

## Maintenance & Updates

### Monitoring Requirements
- **Monthly**: Review optimization performance and business objective alignment
- **Quarterly**: Validate that customer behavior patterns haven't fundamentally changed
- **Annually**: Comprehensive system audit including fairness and bias assessment
- **As Needed**: Retrain models when major business changes or market shifts occur

### Success Metrics for Production
- **Primary**: Conversion rate improvement (target: +20-30% based on demonstrated results)
- **Secondary**: Session value, customer satisfaction, return visit rates
- **Risk Indicators**: Customer complaint rates, unusual behavior pattern detection
- **Fairness Metrics**: Performance consistency across customer demographic segments

### Academic Transparency Statement
This model card documents a sophisticated methodology demonstration using simulation-based business modeling calibrated to real customer behavior data. The €2.79 million revenue impact represents simulated potential based on demonstrated optimization methodology rather than validated business outcomes. Production implementation requires extensive A/B testing validation and careful stakeholder management.
